### Experience over efficiency: Consistent long-distance foraging flights across years and seasons at colony level in a Neotropical bat

The code presents the analysis workflow to test how Phyllostomus hastatus show consistent foraging flights across years and colonies. The code requires personal log in information of movebank and stadia maps.

The code follows as:

1. CleaningData_Bocas2021-2022
2. CleaningData_2023
3. CleaningData_2016
4. Merge_alldata
5. Behavioral_classification
6. LongCommute_MainlandForaging_Figure1
7. Simulation_Figure2
8. Turning_angles_straightness
9. Foraging_coordination_Figure3
10. Figure_1
11. FigureS2

Additional .csv files are included in this repository.

Colonies have been renamed as colony 1, 2 and 3. Original names are
- La Gruta = colony 1
- Aj cave = colony 2
- Muddy cave= colony 3
